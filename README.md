# Plot_xrdml
Small python script to plot X-ray data from xrdml file 

The script automatically extracts the data from all children folders of the current path.

The data is extracted using regular expressions.

A separate plot is created for every datafile and a combined plot is created for all the xray data.

Idiosyncratic naming conventions are there but hopefully comments make the purpose of each line clear.
